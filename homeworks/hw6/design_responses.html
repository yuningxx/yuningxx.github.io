					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Super interesting article! I learned a lot about animation choices that I never noticed in my daily use 
								of apps. I've taken these animations for granted for too long! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The blue vs red animation examples throughout the article are amazing. I can't imagine the effort that 
								went into making those. Without those examples I won't understand a single paragraph of it.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Use proper duration in your animation. Don’t make it too fast and don’t leave the user enough time to yawn" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
