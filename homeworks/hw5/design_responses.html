                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that website UI design applies to a wide variety of products, not just internet-based ones. 
                                I also noticed that all of these inspirations emphasize motion based on user interaction. When the user
                                slides, clicks, and scrolls, the website becomes really dynamic.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> There was no text to read. Just looking at pretty design examples. What an enjoyable homework for a midterms-fried brain! </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite is the one by Arvin, designed for a wallet app. I like it because it turns finance - something we 
                                commonly think of as serious and dull - into a delightful experience. The use of color is excellent. Bright, 
                                exciting colors. The motion of cards and the menu is also engaging.  </p>
                        </li>
