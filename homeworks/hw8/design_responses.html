				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> There is quite a variety of how Dark Patterns are implemented!
							When I first heard of this concept in lecture, I was wondering 
							what is the boundary between Dark Patterns and simply nudging users
							through UI/UX choices. By reading this article, it became clearer to
							me that Dark Patterns involve some form of deception and dishonesty,
							whereas nudging does not.  </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Not necessarily a part of this article, but the link to the website 
							called Deceptive Pattern is really cool. I spent some time exploring 
							the website, and I especially liked reading their "Hall of Shame". </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> Despite these possible solutions, there is still a gap. It is the designerâ€™s moral code. The implications of the products they create needs to be considered.
