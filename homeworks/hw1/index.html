        Hello! My name is Yuning. My favorite color is green. I enjoy watching soccer videos on YouTube and I (occasionally) play League. <br>
        I don't cook very often. But when I do, I cook very well!

        <li>I learned to pay more attention to the visual design of the apps/websites we interact with, not just their functionalities.
            The design can have powerful effects on how users make decisions and interact with the app. 
        </li>
        <li>My favorite part is the examples picked by the author to demonstrate the design decisions of different apps. 
            I never looked at Twitter/Airbnb/Spotify in those ways before!

        <li>"Open an app you use often and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen in front of you."</li>
