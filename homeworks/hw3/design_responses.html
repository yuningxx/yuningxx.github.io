						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Typography is actually much more sophisticated than I thought! I'm used to picking
								which font looks best in the narrowest sense - the look of its letters - but now
								I learned that you should also consider how different fonts pair together, and how 
								you should space your lines (Golden ratio!). </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I especially liked the sharing of websites/resources for picking fonts and font pairs.
								I also liked the graphic examples in the article.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
