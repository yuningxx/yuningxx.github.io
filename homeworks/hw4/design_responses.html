							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that providing accessibility for my website is not only a good thing to do, but in some cases it might be 
								a legal responsibility. I also learned that better accessibility can be achieved not only by adjusting your color 
								scheme but also by adding text descriptions and graphics.  </p>
